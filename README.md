# TelescopingJets
Analysis tools for the Telescoping Jets project

################################
# First time setup
################################
After checking out the code which allows you to see this README, you must install three third party sources of code that are used by this outlined below with tips from our experience.  Note that these must be housed at the same level as the TelescopingJets code that you checked out.  This is particularly true in the case of event generation with Pythia8 

### Pythia8: http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html 
1) No tips here.  But if you are not familiar with Pythia then it is worthwhile working through the worksheet outlined here http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/pythia8/worksheet8183.pdf since the EventGeneration code is built starting from this.

### fastjet : http://fastjet.fr/
1) Check out the latest stable version - I have it working with fastjet-3.1.1 and the paths are configured to look for this, so if you don't check out this version, you will need to modify some paths in the compile.sh scripts

### fastjet contrib : http://fastjet.hepforge.org/contrib/ \\
1) When installing, it is necessary to point the code to the fastjet install directory as shown in the install directions.  This is done via the [--fastjet-config=FILE] argument.  For me, on Mac OSX, when I installed fastjet, this meant pointing it to the fastjet-config at ../fastjet-3.1.1/fastjet-config.  If you do this correctly, then you should see the /contrib directory housed in /usr/local/include/fastjet/.

# Running EventGeneration
################################
This is the first state of analysis in which the Pythia8 event generator is used to produce a set of events for any process you wish and perform the subsequent shower and hadronization to produce a set of final state particles that can then be used for analysis via jet building.
#### Where : 
Ana_EventGeneration
#### How : 
$ source compile.sh

$ ./MakeNTupleFromPythia 1 pythia_wz.root

#### What :
This will generate 500 events and save to the pythia_wz.root output file a flat ntuple that contains truth vectors of the relevant particles (W,Z) for truth tagging later along with vector<double> branches for all of the truth particles with final state particles.

#### TODO :
1) Batch system on TeVCluster.

2) Modify truth 4vector storing to store W 4-vectors for both W' and ttbar events so that you can use them for truth matching in the next stage.

################################
# Running NTupling
################################
This is the second stage of analysis that takes as input the set of final state particles from Pythia and runs jet building and calculation of jet moments (substructure) on these jets using fastjet and fastjet contrib.  In particular, the Telescoping Jets code is run at this level of analysis.  This should always be made to produce a flat ntuple that has no complicated structure to it but is composed simply of branches of doubles.
### Where : 
Ana_NTupleMaker
### How : 
$ source compile.sh

$ ./NTupler 1 pythia\_wz.root NTuple\_wz.root

#### What :
This will process the 500 events generated with the MakeNTupleFromPythia code and do the following:
1) run jet finding on the truth constituents 
2) determine truth flavor of jets via dR matching using the truth 4-vectors from the (W,Z)
3) calculate basic TJet volatility for these jets

The output will be saved in the file NTuple_wz.root

#### TODO :
1) Batch system on TeVCluster.

2) Put in CMS jet configuration (antikt R=0.8 pruned).

3) Build in more sophisticated truth matching for ttbar events so that you can ensure that you are really looking at a top jet when we call it signal, not just a jet from a ttbar event that is really a W jet or a frankenstein q+b jet.

################################
# Running MiniNTupleAnalysis
################################
This is the final stage of analysis where the analyzer uses any method they wish to analyze the flat ntuple of jets from the previous stage and produce final results.  The preferred method is to use the TTree::Draw method (https://root.cern.ch/root/html/TTree.html#TTree:Draw@2) to quickly make histograms that can be used for further calculation.  This means that in principle there should be *no event loop* in this part of the code.  This is made more amenable by implementing all analysis tools with pyROOT.
### Where : 
Ana_MiniNTupleAnalysis
### How : 
$ python MakeROCS.py

#### What :
These scripts should be made to produce final plots and results that are presentable and adhere to some sort of style guideline to make them easily interpretable.

#### TODO:
1) Make this code work with new inputs from the previous stage

#### NOTE :
As it currently stands, this requires that you obtain an additional directory from outside of GitHub that contains the root files that will be read in.  This directory is housed on DropBox at:

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hfu09io74gswafp/AACf_8KucJmvTsDB-1iQ_JeDa?dl=0

and you should copy this entire "Data" directory to the same level as the repository you just checked out.
